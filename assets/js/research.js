LockBit’s ransomware attack on Evolve and the risk it placed on its partnership network show why the industry needs to focus more on the foundations of zero trust across financial networks. When the Federal Reserve finds gaps two weeks before a ransom attack, it’s time to rethink cyber resilience and cybersecurity at the company and industry level. CISOs are needed to bring the resilience and about fintechs need to stay secure and grow.",
